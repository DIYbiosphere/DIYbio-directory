# Code of Conduct (CoC)
This Code of Conduct\* applies to project spaces and public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community, online and offline.

As contributors of this project, we are committed to having a **welcoming environment for all people to contribute**, and we pledge to value them as human beings and foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and understanding. We take the [Contributor Covenant] as a way to express these values.

We want to sustain a **harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation.

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

**Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting a [project manager\*\*].**

Project managers are obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the incident's reporter. All reports will be reviewed. Contributors with unacceptable behavior­­­—be it inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful—shall be banned temporarily or permanently, and contributions may be removed or rejected. Project maintainers commit ourselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to the project, those who don't may be suspended or removed.
