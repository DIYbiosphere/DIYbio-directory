## About
The mission of Opentrons is to provide the scientific community with a common platform to easily share protocols and reproduce each other's results. Their robots automate experiments that would otherwise be done by hand, allowing our community to spend more time pursuing answers to some of the 21st centuryâ€™s most important questions.
