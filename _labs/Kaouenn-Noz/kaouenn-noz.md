We are individuals who gather and assemble not satisfied with four walls and a roof. We light campfires to practice techniques together, we survey the sciences in and with the living, we revisit technology through the critic - in hermeneutics of the eo ipso of observations on the state of the art in various historical periods, in terms of tools and know-how. It also means that we are open and welcoming

Our approach to doing together and reverse together is liminal & interstitial 

In the "Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Plantationocene, Chthulucene" we move forward and confront the concepts with their contradictions, we discuss them.

We contribute to the histories of biology, the one that is participatory, open, free, in the commons, amateur. We feed on forgotten histories in order not to reproduce the evils of the past. 


We use what is free, we liberate what is closed. We assemble free and open, we produce free and open objects, we document what we do and what we question. We do not take ourselves seriously. We are childrens of popular culture and from the failures of counterculture
