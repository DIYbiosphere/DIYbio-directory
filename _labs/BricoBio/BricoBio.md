Our next goal is to grow our community of bio-scientists / bio-artists / bioenthusiasts, to create a leadership team and to start an organization that does really interesting work and that responds to our community’s interests and needs (and hopefully finds a way to be sustainable too).

Our shared purpose is to  transform life sciences and democratize biotechnology  to inspire creativity and improve lives by organizing change makers and enthusiasts to...

    - build an inclusive global network,

    - cultivate an accessible commons of knowledge and resources,

    - launch community labs and projects

    - enable educators.

We have a history of teaching workshops, hosting artists, starting companies and lots more.
