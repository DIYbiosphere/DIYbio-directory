INCUBATOR art lab at the Intersection of Art, Science and Ecology is a physical and theoretical hub, a new art/science laboratory at The University of Windsor. Founded in 2009, it functions both as an apparatus in which environmental conditions can be controlled towards the assisted growth of life, but also as a site supporting the development of new ideas and artistic practices.
