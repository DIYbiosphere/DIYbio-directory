#The Avocado lab is a fictitious lab created for educational purposes.

Do-it-yourself biological innovation! We're inspired by the California group "biocurious", like them, we believe in the power of open source, open access, and learning with the community. We are a community of bio-enthusiasts in the Toronto area who are fascinated by the miniature world of molecular biology.
