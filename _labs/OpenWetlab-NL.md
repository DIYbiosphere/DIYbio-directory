# Open Wetlab
The Open Wetlab at the Waag Society in Amsterdam is a Life Sciences community lab for makers, designers, artists, DIY biologists, scientists, and citizen scientists [(1)][1].

## About
The Open Wetlab focuses on life sciences and the design and ethics of life. We want to involve the industry, artists and designers, but also the political forces and the public, hands-on in the shaping of biotechnology, as well as in what biotechnology creates.
The Open Wetlab offers a platform and discusses other forms of knowledge production in addition to the scientific one. Via a hands-on approach (where you enter in contact and use the technology) the Wetlab wants to give a different interpretation for the debate on usefulness and desirability of Life Sciences in society. Every week on Tuesday evening you are welcome to work on your own project.

Open Wetlab promotes the production of bio-art because we believe that bio-art is visionary and can be guiding for new prototypes and applications. Thus, we investigate to what extent and how art and science can work together and in what way art can influence a scientific agenda. Finally, Wetlab develops workshops and conducts research in the field of biotechnology and sustainability.

After number of years and projects propagating art, science and biotechnology, Waag Society is proud to announce the start of their Open Wetlab: the ‘open and wet’ laboratory facility in proximity of Waag Society's Fablab Amsterdam. Open as in Open Source hardware and Open Source protocols; Wet as in laboratories where living biological matter is handled and as in OpenWetware.


The Open Wetlab is there for education, outreach, community building, creativity, arts, entrepreneurship and for fun. The Open Wetlab will organise workshops, have resident artists, scientists entrepreneurs and makers of other kinds. It will offer space to work on a variety of biology, life sciences, bio information projects. The Open Wetlab will host a platform for Open Source hardware and protocols of wetlab practice.

## History
The Open Wetlab was oficially opene on June 21st 2013 [(1)][1] with the exhibition of the 3-day workshop Do It Together Bio, the International premiere of BioARTCAMP: A Rocky Mountain Adventure in Art and Biology and a party with GMO beer.
