Biotown was a community-run open-access laboratory in Ottawa, Canada. With ever decreasing barriers for entry into scientific research, DIYBio spaces, are starting a global revolution in scientific understanding and experimentation. The goal was to provide individuals, both amateur and experts, with the tools and knowledge to solve complex problems using biotechnology.
The National Capital Region is home to four Universities, two Colleges, two Provinces and the Federal Government; it is also one of North Americaâ€™s most active technology hubs.
This group became inactive in 2018. Many of its active members transferred to Ottawa Bio Science Group.
