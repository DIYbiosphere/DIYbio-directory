#### responsive design targets
- [ ] landing
  - [ ] logo shrinks to just square image, no text
  - [ ] global search box is front & center
  - [ ] use grid of 8 collection types as dynamic filter buttons
  - [ ] entries list component rendered below

- [ ] entries list/filter view
  - [ ] left-hand sidebar turns into button cloud
    - [x] in progress
    - [ ] turn into narrow stack of colored labels
    - [ ] https://semantic-ui.com/elements/label.html#colored-group
    - [ ] see `entries.html`
  - [ ] use as partial on landing page instead of dedicated page
  - [ ] search menu removed in favor of global search in top navbar
  - [ ] viewTable component in searchbox is unnecessary
  - [ ] pagination goes at bottom

- [x] views using `entry` layout
  - [x] social icons integrated into infobox
  - [x] metadata box floats below main content box, full-width in responsive mode
  - [x] refactor `info-box` partial
    - [x] create ___custom partial___ for better spacing instead of using table
  - [x] `tags` partial fine-tuned



#### code review questions & TODOs
  - replace remotely-hosted resources with local copies
    - regex: ```\<(script|link).*(src|href)=\"http.*\>```
    - `_layouts/default.html` js script src
    - `_includes/head.html` js script src, css, & fonts
  - **prune/hide unused components**:
  - is npm/node used? what's up package.json?
  - semantic includes flag icons, so why do we also include lafeber/world-flags-sprite  (css/vendor/flags-16)?
  - `_includes/tabs.html`, `_includes/contentMenu.html` tabular elements used for entry views
    - i.e. `projects/RealVeganCheese/RealVeganCheese`
    - only used in `_layouts`: docs, entry, entry-example, page?
  - jekyll throwing warning during build:
  ```
  Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2017-12-15 05:53:28        Deprecation: posts.each should be changed to posts.docs.each.
              Called by ["/Users/100ideas/.local/rbenv/versions/2.3.6/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/jekyll-3.6.2/lib/jekyll/collection.rb:39:in `method_missing'"].
  ```
    - may be caused by dependency mismatch; `jekyll-sitemap` insists on installing `jekyll-last-modified-at v0.3.4` but latest is v1.0.1
      - https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap/blob/master/jekyll-sitemap.gemspec#L24
      - https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at/issues/41

#### local development setup
  - see guide `docs/tutorials/local-install`
  - `brew install rbenv`
  - `rbenv install 2.3.6`
  - `rbenv global 2.3.6`
  - `gem install bundler`
  - clone repo & enter directory `cd sphere`
  - `bundle`
  - `bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --profile`

##### deploy
  Still figuring out how this all works; here's what I've got so far:

  - change default configs as needed (don't want to commit this back to upstream)
    - I forked the original repo, made a `responsive branch` where I keep my contributions and `responsive-deploy` which holds deploy-specific changes to config files like `_config.yml` (set url & baseurl; disable algolia; delete CNAME file). I work locally in `responsive`, then merge when I want to deploy.
  - to deploy, push to remote branch (responsive-deploy) that netlify is tracking for deployments

###### old deploy instructions
  - to setup gh-pages deployment to github-pages w/o travisCI etc...:

  ```bash
  # do this once

  # get onto the deploy branches
  git checkout responsive-deploy
  git pull
  # delete remote `gh-pages` branch
  git push -d origin gh-pages
  # recreate and add empty dir to git index
  rm -rf _site && mkdir _site && git add _site/ && git commit -m "init _site/"
  ```

  ```bash
  # do this anytime you need to redeploy gh-pages

  # clean _site
  rm -rf _site && jekyll build --verbose
  # add the compiled site to git
  git add _site/ && git commit -m "jekyll compile into _site/"
  # now for the magic: _dist subtree becomes remote gh-pages branch
  git subtree push --prefix _site origin gh-pages
    # if problems, delete the remote gh-pages branch & try again
    git push -d origin gh-pages
  # repeat the last 3 commands to redeploy!

  # notes:
  # toggle _sites on/off in .gitignore during local dev
  # use the following to unstage:
  git reset _site
  ```
