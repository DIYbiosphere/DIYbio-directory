The DIYbiosphere collects and maintains entries on Do-it-Yourself biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world in a distributed manner, similar to a wiki but we use [GitHub Pages][gh_pages]. Using [GitHub] has the benefit of writing entries in [Markdown] (a simple text formatting syntax), and it allows for a flexible and open development framework. For more technical details read our [software] section in the [documentation].

The project is participatory and completely open-source\*. Everyone can access and (re)use the content on our website at [sphere.diybio.org][sphere], as the work is dedicated to the public domain, except where otherwise noted. Anyone can also contribute to the project: _writers_ [add] or [edit] entries, and _developers_ parcipate in the development; the software, design, and overall direction of the project. Go to our repository at [DIYbiosphere/sphere][gh_repo] to see how to get started to contribute. You can also get involved and [become a member][join] of the [development community][community].

DIYbiosphere has four main goals. One is to create a central platform to find and learn about DIYbio initiatives. Two is to provide the DIYbio community a simple way to post and share their initiatives. Three is to have an open-source project to foster connection to DIYbio projects, people, and ideas. And four is to map and visualize the DIYbio community. Learn more about our mission, vision, and values in [our philosophy] page.
