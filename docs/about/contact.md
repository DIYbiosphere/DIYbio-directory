As part of [our values] we strive to maintain our communication as public as possible.

<a class="noelink" href="https://github.com/DIYbiosphere/sphere/issues"><button class="ui right floated tiny black right labeled icon button"><i class="github icon"></i>Submit an Issue on GitHub</button></a>

## GitHub Issues
We use GitHub's Issues to organize and manage the development of the project, and it is here where the majority of conversations relating to the project should happen. The [Issues][gh_issues] are public, but in order to submit a new issue you need a GitHub account ([sign up][gh_join]). You can submit a [question][s_question], [suggestion][s_suggestion], or a [request to join][join] the [development communtiy][community].

## Gitter
[Gitter] is a chat service. So far, we have a public chatroom for the sphere repository at [gitter.im/DIYbiosphere/sphere][gitter]. Post your message or Direct Message (DM) another user.

<a class="noelink" href="https://diybiosphere.herokuapp.com/"><button class="ui right floated tiny right labeled icon teal button"><i class="slack icon"></i>Join us on Slack</button></a>

## Slack
Is a very popular communication platform that offers integration with other services including GitHub notifications. We have our own Slack: [DIYbiosphere.slack.com][slack]. You have to [request an invite][invite], which you receive by email. You can join any channel and specify your notification preferences. Post your message in a channel or DM other users.

{% include messages/info.html title="Gitter vs Slack" text="For the moment, there is no preference on what communication platform will be used more often. As the project gains members and contributors, the most popular communication platform will win." %}
