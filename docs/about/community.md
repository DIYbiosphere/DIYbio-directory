Anyone with a GitHub account ([sign up]) can be a contributor and create or edit content and participate in the development of DIYbiosphere. The development is managed by members of the [DIYbiosphere organization][gh_org] organization account on GitHub, which anyone can freely [join]. Members have _write_ access to the repository and can edit files directly without the need of pull requests. The organization is divided into several **teams** (only visible to members) with specific roles in project:

- **Board of Directors:** oversee the general direction and development of the project. They also have _admin_ and _owner_ control over the sphere repository and the DIYbiosphere organization respectively.
  - Jason Bobe: Chief Executive Officer - @JasonBobe
  - Gabriela A. Sanchez: Chief Project Officer - @sabgaby
- **Core Developers:** coordinate the software and the content of the entries as well as their design. They have _admin_ access to the sphere respository
  - Daniel Sanchez: Chief Technical Officer - @cube5
  - Steven Stowell: Chief Content Officer - @SteveStowell
- **Editors:** are in charge of curating entries and their content
- **Managers:** are all users who are in charge of one or many entries

## Partners
The project is done in partnership with the [DIYbio.org][diybio] network, and with the support of the [University of Geneva][unige]. If you want to become a partner, please contact @sabgaby or @JasonBobe.
