The DIYbiosphere is an [open-source][gh_repo] and participatory project, which means anyone can contribute to its content and development. As an open organization we want to be able to fluidly coordinate a large number of contributors while maintaining and striving towards a shared vision for the project.

## Our Mission
To provide an open platform for DIYbio initiatives to **share** and **learn** about and from each other. To encourage the DIYbio community to engage with one another and to facilitate the free flow of knowledge and resources. We want to generate opportunities and potentials by creating a common project to collaborate on. To have a shared space where the DIYbio community can connect, meet, support, and work together.

## Our Vision
The information we gather (share) will give valuable insights (learn) about the diversity of the DIYbio movement; the different places, sizes, intentions, and hopes that configure and motivate the community and its participants. The DIYbiosphere is more than an index, a list, a database, or a directory of DIYbio initiatives, its purpose is to get a sense of the DIYbio community: _who_ we are, _what_ we do, and _where_ we are heading.

## Our Values
The way that we work, collaborate, and engage with other members of the DIYbiosphere community should always value:

- **Openness:** to enable contributors to (re)use and modify the project and participate in its development, and to keep communication public and transparent (except when sensitive) as a way to encourage open conversations and keep track of them.
- **Equality:** ensure anyone can participate by creating an inclusive and friendly environment. Encourage wider use and greater participation by making things accesible, easy to use and contribute.
- **Respect:** treat each other with kindness and value others' contributions, opinions, and beliefs. Do not be mean or insulting. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.
- **Collaboration:** nurture a culture that fosters working together. To trust each others judgements and areas of expertise. We also urge contributors to actively participate and take on responsabilities in the project.
- **Community:** to permeate a sense of community in everything we do. Understand that we need to work together and depend on each others' work, help, and expertise.

We have a [Code of Conduct] which establishes a common understanding of what is deemed a welcoming and friendly working environment as well as establishing how to deal with unacceptable behavior and its consequences.

## Our Governance
We are committed to be as open as possible while maintaining a sense of structure that is able to clearly define roles and responsabilities for users in the project. We do this by coordinating members of the development community through an organization account in GitHub: [DIYbiosphere][gh_org].
