### This site is still under development, we are working hard to make it grow and be fully functional.

Welcome to the public repository for the [DIYbiosphere] database and website!

## About
The DIYbiosphere  is a **participatory project** to create a **worldwide database** of Do-it-Yourself Biology **(DIYbio) initiatives**, which include Projects and organizations such as Labs, Groups, Startups, Incubators, and Networks.

The goal of DIYbiosphere is to have a **common space** where we can **share** about **who we are** and **what we do**, in the hopes that we can **collaborate** and **learn** about and from each other.

For more information see the meta section in our [About] page, or check out our project's [entry] in the DIYbiosphere database.

The database functions as an editable website, similar to a wiki, using the technologies of: <br>
**+** [Git] to version-control the files in the database <br>
**+** [GitHub] to web-host the files in a public repository <br>
**+** [GitHub Pages] to host the repository as a website <br>
**+** [Jekyll] to build the static webpages from plain text <br>
**+** [Travis] to test and deploy the static pages to GitHub
