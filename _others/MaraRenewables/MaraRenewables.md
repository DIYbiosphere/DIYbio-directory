We believe there has never been a more critical need to evolve cost-effective, renewable commodities through scientific advancement. At heart, Mara is a research and development firm. We plan to develop and continually improve upon our unique, patent protected technologies to become the preferred supplier of omega-3 fatty acids in human nutrition and related industries - but our overarching vision is to go even further. We aspire to become a leading developer of advanced, sustainable algae-based bio-products and in-doing so will support a cleaner and healthier future.
